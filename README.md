# Mobile-Price-Range-Prediction
On the basis of the mobile Specification like Battery power, 3G enabled , wifi ,Bluetooth, Ram etc we are predicting Price range of the mobile this kind of prediction will help companies estimate price of mobiles to give tough competion to other mobile manufacturer also it will be usefull for Consumers to verify that they are paying best price for a mobile.
# Dataset :
Dataset has 2000 rows and 21 columns.
The features are **battery_power , blue, clock_speed, dual_sim, fc, four_g,int_memory, m_dep, mobile_wt, n_cores, pc, px_height, px_width, ram, sc_h, sc_w, talk_time, three_g, touch_screen, wifi, price_range**.
 
# Model Trained:

 * Linear Regression
 
 * Decision Tree 
 
 * Random Forest 
 
 * XGboost
 
 * KNN
 
 # Conclusion:
 * It was seen that ram,battery power, px_height,px_width has the highest impact on the price of the mobile.
 
 * The KNN model performed the best and most consistently while predicting the different classes of the output. Hence, it was concluded that the KNN model was the best among all.
